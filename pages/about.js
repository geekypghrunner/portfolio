				In August of 2017, I was bit by the programming bug and began my dive
				into the world of web development. Beginning with the basics of HTML and
				CSS from Codecademy, I found my way to The Odin Project. It's here that
				I experienced the awesomeness of JavaScript followed by an adventure
				through the workings of Ruby and Ruby on Rails. While the sheer mass of
				information was overwhelming at times, I was absorbing new concepts at
				every change I had.
			</p>
			<p>
				Knowing the reality of affording a second college degree or attending a
				bootcamp were out of the question, the plan was to continue the scouring
				of the internet for additional free resources for learning. Around the
				time of finishing The Odin Project curriculum, I applied for and
				received a scholarship to complete the Udacity Front-End Developer
				Nanodegree. This program exposed me to the JavaScript frameworks of the
				world, with a special focus on React. At the same time, I also was given
				the opportunity at one of my jobs to implement a MERN app to solve the
				time management challenge faced by college students. In the end, the
				nanodegree was finished well ahead of schedule and the app deployed to
				production.
			</p>
			<p>
				The time then came to prepare for a career shift. Teaching is
				fulfilling in its own ways, but being a life-long learner who loves to
				problem-solve has made me drawn toward the life of a web developer.  Since June of 2019,
				I have been working on as full-stack engineer refining my front-end skills while also
				developing talents as a Python programmer.  While working in healthcare tech during the day,
				ed tech and fin tech are definite areas that intrigue me in my off hours.
